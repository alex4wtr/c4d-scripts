<b>paste-spline-from-houdini-geometry-spreadsheet.py</b></br>

<b>replace-rendersettings-from-scene.py</b></br>
Replace Rendersettings from another Scene. <u>Very useful</u> for <b>huge</b> scenes ( >1GB ). It can be a pain to load the whole scene into memory, if you just want to copy the rendersettings. This will speed up the process by a ton, because it's only loading the rendersettings from that file.</br></br>
<b>DEFAULT-CLICK: APPEND RENDERSETTINGS</b></br>
<b>CTRL-CLICK: OVERWRITE RENDERSETTINGS</b></br>
