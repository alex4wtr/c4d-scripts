<b>replace-rendersettings-from-scene.py</b></br>
Replaces your current rendersettings from another Scene. <u>Very useful</u> for <b>huge</b> scenes ( >1GB ). It can be a pain to load the whole scene, if you just want to copy the rendersettings into another scene. This will speed up the process because it's not loading any objects into the memory.</br>
